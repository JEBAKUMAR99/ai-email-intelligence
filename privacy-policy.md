**Last Updated:** February 26, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

AI Email Intelligence for Zoho CRM (“the Extension”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a productivity extension designed to help users analyze emails within Zoho CRM and generate AI-assisted summaries, insights, and suggested replies.

We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of customer information. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension accesses, how it is processed, and how it is protected.

By installing or using this Extension, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Information We Access

The Extension operates inside the user’s Zoho CRM account and accesses only the data required to perform its functionality.

The Extension may access the following Zoho CRM data:

* CRM record details (Leads, Contacts, Deals, or related modules)
* Email content associated with CRM records
* Sender and recipient email addresses
* Email subject lines
* Email body content
* User name and organization ID

The Extension does **not** access unrelated CRM modules or files unless required for functionality.

---

## 3. How the Data Is Used

The accessed data is used strictly for the following purposes:

* Generating AI-based email summaries
* Providing suggested replies
* Identifying sentiment and key discussion points
* Improving user productivity inside Zoho CRM

The Extension does not use the accessed data for marketing, advertising, profiling, or resale.

---

## 4. AI Processing and Third-Party Services

To generate summaries and smart replies, the Extension sends selected email content to an external Artificial Intelligence (AI) processing service.

This may include:

* Email body text
* Email subject
* Conversation context

The data is transmitted securely over encrypted HTTPS connections.

The AI service processes the data only to generate a response requested by the user. The data is **not intentionally used to train public machine learning models** by us.

We do not sell, rent, or share customer CRM data with third parties for commercial purposes.

---

## 5. Data Storage

The Extension **does not permanently store email content or CRM record data** on our servers.

We do not maintain a copy of:

* customer emails
* CRM records
* attachments

Data may temporarily pass through our secure server only for processing and is discarded immediately after the AI response is generated.

---

## 6. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards, including:

* HTTPS encrypted communication
* Secure API authentication
* Access token protection
* Server-side processing protections

We do not store Zoho CRM login credentials.

Authentication to Zoho CRM is handled using Zoho’s official OAuth authorization mechanism.

---

## 7. User Control and Responsibility

The Zoho CRM account owner and organization administrators remain the data controllers of all CRM data.

Users are responsible for:

* deciding which emails to analyze
* determining whether sensitive information should be processed using AI services

The Extension processes data only when a user explicitly triggers the analysis.

---

## 8. Data Deletion

Because the Extension does not permanently store customer data, most information is automatically discarded after processing.

If a user or organization wishes to ensure removal of any transient processing logs, they may contact us at the support email below. We will respond within 7 business days.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy

The Extension is a business productivity tool and is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date.

Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
